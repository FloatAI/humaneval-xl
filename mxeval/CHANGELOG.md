## v1.1
* Bugfix:<br>
Fix unit test cases for 47 problemsâ€™ test assertions for C#/TypeScript/Go, which represents ~5% of all problems:<br> 
Root cause of the issue is a possibility for the input parameters to the canonical solutions get mutated as a side-affect which cause the captured input to mismatch.<br>
We fix this issue by saving another copy of the function input before passing it for execution.
